Gives users the possibility to customize the look and feel of their profile pages. 

Features:
- Change background image (default or uploaded)
- Change background layout (position,repeat, fixed/scroll)
- Change a number of colors (background, widget background, header, fonts etc)
- Live Preview when changing colors and background

If you need to change the colors that can be configured (and know a little php), check out the views/default/customstyle/colors.php file. In it you will find an array of all the elements that can be configured by the user. Delete entries or add as you see fit.
